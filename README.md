# Rock-Paper-Scissors
📚 What I Learned

Through building this project, I learned and practiced:

🎯 Functions & Parameters

Passing values like 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' into functions to control game logic.

🖥️ DOM Manipulation

Dynamically updating text content and elements using JavaScript.

💾 Local Storage

Saving and retrieving game scores so they persist after refreshing the page.

🔧 JSON

Using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to store objects in localStorage.

⚡ Event Handling

Using onclick events to trigger game actions.

🕹️ Game Logic

Comparing user input with randomly generated computer moves to determine wins, losses, or ties.


How the Game Works

-User clicks Rock, Paper, or Scissors

-Computer randomly selects a move

-The game logic determines:

      Win
      
      Loss
      
      Tie

-Score is updated and saved in localStorage

-The UI updates instantly using DOM manipulation
