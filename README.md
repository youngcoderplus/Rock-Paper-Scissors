# 📚 What I Learned

## 🔹 *Functions & Parameters*
* Passing values like **'rock'**, **'paper'**, and **'scissors'** into functions  
* Using parameters to make functions reusable and clean  
* Separating logic into small, meaningful functions  

---

## 🔹 *DOM Manipulation*
* Updating text content dynamically using **JavaScript**
* Selecting elements using `document.querySelector`
* Changing UI based on game results  

---

## 🔹 *Local Storage*
* Saving game scores in **localStorage**
* Retrieving stored data after page refresh
* Making the game state persist between sessions  

---

## 🔹 *JSON*
* Using `JSON.stringify()` to store objects
* Using `JSON.parse()` to retrieve objects
* Understanding why JSON is needed for localStorage  

---

## 🔹 *Event Handling*
* Using **onclick** events to trigger game logic
* Connecting user actions to JavaScript functions
* Handling button clicks efficiently  

---

## 🔹 *Game Logic*
* Comparing user input with randomly generated computer moves
* Determining **win**, **lose**, or **draw** outcomes
* Applying conditional logic to control game flow  

---

## 🔹 *Acknowledgements*
* Got some assistance and guidance from [Super Simple Dev](https://supersimple.dev) in creating this project
